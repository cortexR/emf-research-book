    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe best book for scientific ideas, including generating new ideas and bringing ideas to life – within the field of biological and health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF).\n\n\nThis is a collection of theories and hypotheses related to the study of biological and health effects of non-ionizing radiation.\nThe book is an open science project started in 2024 and is work in progress. A final edition may take years to complete. Scientists and authors familiar with the topic can contribute and will be credited for any contribution. If you want to contribute, you can simply submit additions and revisions at the book’s GitHub repository. Currently, I serve as the editor, but that may be changed if more experienced authors decide to contribute.\nThe book at this page will remain free. The book is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. Potentially, additional paperback, hard copy or e-book editions can be made available for sale at a future point in time.\nThe aim of the book is to be a comprehensive list of the theories and hypotheses related to non-ionizing radiation that can be used for researchers and others who want to familiar themselves with the topic; look up potential frameworks to interpret findings; or explore research gaps and possible new research questions and methods.\nThe aim is not to discuss specific research findings, but rather to provide a scope of theories. However, relevant scientific references for each theory should be included. But to support the progress of the development of this book, such lists may most often not be exhaustive, meaning that a theory may be included with one reference initially that is not necessarily the most updated and correct reference.\nIt is also not the aim that theories or hypotheses included should have been proven to be correct (or scientifically speaking, not haven been falsified). Theories that are speculative, or even wrong, may also be included, and the reader should be aware this. The reason for this is that ideas that have not yet been researched may have extra value in that they may point to research gaps, and theories that have proven wrong may prohibit other researchers to waste their efforst following that same path.",

PubMed indexes and makes searchable the contents of these databases; MEDLINE is the primary component of PubMed.\n— About PMC\n\n\n\n11.2.1.2 Embase (by Elsevier)(paid-access)\nEmbase has a similar scope to PubMed/MEDLINE - a database for biomedical research literature.\nEmbase claims to contain 99% of journals in MEDLINE, plus 3000 more journals that are not indexed by PubMed. It is stronger on drug literature than MEDLINE. It is also supposed to be better at capturing conference abstracts.\nSee also the about page at Embase.\n\n\n11.2.1.3 Cochrane Reviews database\nWhat is a Cochrane review?\n\nA Cochrane Review is a systematic review of research in health care and health policy that is published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.”\n— About Cochrane Reviews\n\nA total of 9211 Cochrane Reviews had been published as of March 2024.\n\n\n11.2.1.4 SveMed+\nSweMed has better coverage for Scandinavian literature (from) (AI translation):\n\nSveMed+ is a bibliographic database that contains references to articles from Scandinavian journals in the fields of medicine, dentistry, healthcare, occupational therapy, nursing, and physiotherapy.\n\n\n\n11.2.1.5 Epistemonikos\nAbout Epistemonikos from the Norwegian site Helsebiblioteket (AI translation):\n\nEpistemonikos is a free international (multilingual) database that contains systematic reviews on clinical questions. Epistemonikos systematically searches PubMed and other databases for relevant systematic reviews and overviews of reviews on treatment, diagnosis, prognosis, harm, and etiology.\n\nFrom the quote, it seems to focus on clinical questions, i.e. treatment of disease. Although etiology is also mentioned, so the database may provide useful in some instances for health related questions outside treatment of disease.\n\n\n11.2.1.6 CINAHL (by EBSCO) (paid-access)\nThe CINAHL database focuses on nursing, allied health, and healthcare literature:\n\nCINAHL indexes the top nursing and allied health literature available including nursing journals and publications from the National League for Nursing and the American Nurses Association.\n\nIt includes:\n\n3,630 active indexed and abstracted journals 3,320 active peer-reviewed indexed and abstracted journals\n\n\n\n11.2.1.7 Global Health (by EBSCO) (paid-access)\nThe Global Health database focuses on global health issues:\n\nGlobal Health is the only specialized bibliographic, abstracting and indexing database dedicated to public health, completing the picture of international medical and health research by capturing key literature that is not covered by other databases, providing users with a truly global perspective.\n\nIt inludes (as of March, 2025):\n\n\n4,500,000 scientific records from 1973 to the present day\n185,000 records added each year\n7,000 indexed serials, books, book chapters, reports, conference proceedings, patents, theses, electronic publications and other hard-to-find resources\n4,480 journals, of which more than 3,600 are unique to Global Health\n\n\n\n\n11.2.1.8 AMED (paid-access)\nAMED stands for (Allied and Complementary Medicine).\nAbout AMED from the Norwegian page Helsebiblioteket (AI translated):\n\nAMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) registers journal articles in alternative medicine, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, palliative care, speech therapy, and rehabilitation. It covers nearly 600 journals, many of which are not found in other databases.\n\n\n\n11.2.1.9 OVID (paid-access): Search several databases\nOVID allows you to search though multiple databases\n\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, HaPI, AMED, Maternity and Infant Care, Global Health and ERIC (an education-related research database)\nClinical reference sources: BMJ Best Practices, UpToDate\n\n\n\n11.2.1.10 AI tools for literature reviews\nA lot of journals (but not all) submit publications to Semantic Scholar.\nThe following two tools use Semantic scholar as their primary data source:\n\nElicit.com (148 million scientific papers): Good for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\nConsesus.app (&gt;220 million scientific papers): Summaries of “scientific consensus” on any question or research question.\n\nSemantic Scholar is great for for instance finding academic papers and citation analysis. At semanticscholar.org, they say that Semantic Scholar is a “free, AI-powered research tool for scientific literature”.\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Multidisciplinary databases\n\n11.2.2.1 Web of Science (by Clarivate) (paid-access)\nSome main features are listed below. For more information see Web of Science website.\nWeb of Science Core Collection:\n– Number of journals: “&gt; 22,171 journals + books and conference proceedings”\n– Coverage: Over 91 million records; More than 143,000 books; Over 304,000 conferences.\n– Content: “Life sciences, biomedical sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts & humanities. Strongest coverage of natural sciences, health sciences, engineering, computer science, materials sciences.”\nWeb of Science platform\n– Number of journals: “&gt; 34,651 journals + books, proceedings, patents, and data sets”\n– Coverage: Over 217 million records (journals, books, and proceedings);59 million patent families (&gt; 115 million patents); More than 13 million data sets\n– Content: “Biomedical sciences, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts & humanities. Strongest coverage of natural sciences & engineering, computer science, materials sciences, patents, data sets. Regional Citation indexes provide deep coverage in sciences, social sciences, and humanities for Korea, Russia (suspended as of March 2022), Latin America, and China.”\n\n\n11.2.2.2 Scopus (by Elsevier)\nWhat is Scopus (from Wikipedia):\n\nScopus is Elsevier’s abstract and citation database launched in 2004.[1] Scopus covers 36,377 titles (22,794 active titles and 13,583 inactive titles) from 11,678 publishers, of which 34,346 are peer-reviewed journals in top-level subject fields: life sciences, social sciences, physical sciences and health sciences. It covers three types of sources: book series, journals, and trade journals. Scopus also allows patent searches in a dedicated patent database Lexis-Nexis, albeit with a limited functionality.[2]\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Technical disciplines literature databases\n\n11.2.3.1 IEEE Xplore:\nIEEE Xplore lists 6,266,140 items as of April 1 2024.\nThis can be an important additional source for literature related to electromagnetic fields, as it relates to health, even if articles will be more on the technical side, than about health per se.\nIf you for instance search “James Benford” you will see a few example for articles that are not found in PubMed.\nA quick search for “Microwave health” returned 2114 items on April 1 2024, and may give some indication on the number of studies to expect to find of more direct relevance for health in IEEE Xplore.\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Psychology or social sciences literature databases\n\n11.2.4.1 PsychINFO (by APA)\nPsychINFO by APA is a database for literature within the discipline of psychology:\n\nThe premier abstracting and indexing database covering the behavioral and social sciences from the authority in psychology.\n\n\nAPA PsycInfo at a glance • Over 5,000,000 peer-reviewed records • 144 million cited references • Spanning 600 years of content • Updated twice-weekly • Research in 30 languages from 50 countries • Records from 2,400 journals • Content from journal articles, book chapters, and dissertations • AI and machine learning-powered research assistance\n\n\n\n\n11.2.5 Databases that possibly capture literature in languages other than English\n\n11.2.5.1 LIVIVO by ZB MED (German)\nAbout LIVIVO:\n\nLIVIVO is Europe’s largest search engine for literature and information (research data) in the field of life sciences. It is run by ZB MED – Information Centre for Life Sciences. Drawing on nearly 80 million data records, it brings together under one roof the specialist subjects of medicine and health and nutritional, environmental and agricultural sciences. With comprehensive coverage of its core subjects, it supports interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in academic and scientific works.\n\nAbout ZB MED:\n\nZB MED – Information Centre for Life Sciences is Germany’s national infrastructure and research hub for data and information in the life sciences. Our digital services support research projects that benefit people and the environment: from medicine and biodiversity to environmental protection.\n\nZBMED\n\n\n11.2.5.2 LILACS\n\nThe most important index of the technical-scientific literature in Latin America and the Caribbean, LILACS, was created in 1985 to record scientific and technical production in health. It has been maintained and updated by a network of more than 600 institutions of education, government, and health research and coordinated by Latin America and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and World Health Organization (WHO).\nLILACS contains scientific and technical literature from over 908 journals from 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, with free access. About 900,000 records from articles with peer review, theses and dissertations, government documents, conference proceedings, and books; more than 480,000 of them are available with the full-text link in open access.\nThe LILACS Methodology is a set of standards, manuals, guides, and applications in continuous development, intended for the collection, selection, description, indexing of documents, and generation of databases. This centralised methodology enables the cooperation between Latin American and Caribbean countries to create local and national databases, all feeding into the LILACS database. Currently, the databases LILACS, BBO, BDENF, MEDCARIB, and national databases of the countries of Latin America are part of the LILACS System.\nHealth Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) is the multilingual and structured vocabulary created by BIREME to serve as a unique language in indexing articles from scientific journals, books, congress proceedings, technical reports, and other types of materials, and also for searching and retrieving subjects from scientific literature from information sources available on the Virtual Health Library (VHL) such as LILACS, MEDLINE, and others. It was developed from the MeSH with the purpose of permitting the use of common terminology for searching in multiple languages, and providing a consistent and unique environment for the retrieval of information. DeCS vocabulary is dynamic and totals 34,118 descriptors and qualifiers, of which 29,716 come from MeSH, and 4,402 are exclusive.\n\nThe quote is from this link.",

For instance a researcher listed “the best journals in electromagnetic fields and waves in 2019”, at ResearchGate in June, 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that impact factors may vary overtime. For instance the for the journal Frontiers in Public Health, which has an own section for the speciality of Radiation and Health, the impact factor was 3.709, then 6.461 in 2022. The journals usually list their impact factor at their website (the impact factor was 3.0 for Frontiers in Public Health in March 2025).\n\n\n11.3.2 h-index\nAnother indicator to look at is the h-index, which is the largest number h such that h articles published [for a given period] have at least h citations each.\nA list at Google Scholarlists the h5-index for the top publications within the category Physics & Medicine/Electromagnetism. A screenshot of the list from 30 March 2025 is shown below.\nNone of the lists mentioned above may however not be the most relevant for publications specifially related to health and EMFs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Scimago Journal & Country Rank\nAt Scimago Journal & Country Rank you can inspect different metrics of journal indicating the quality of the research in it.\n\n\n\n\nGlaser, Zorach R., and Christopher H.

They might be stimulating, engaging or just fun or provocative to read.\n\nToday, all have their own phones. Particularly with the introduction of the fifth generation of mobile technlogy (5G) and beamforming, being close to others can increase exposure.\nIf it is so that RF-EMF is a stressor, a question becomes, can there be subliminal conditioning (pavlovian), where the body experience stress when close to others, and thus starts to associate being close to others as stressful.\nHow can such a theory be tested? Rats can be mounted with their own mini “mobile phone” with beamforming technology in a rat city with transmission antennas around the “city”. Control groups do not have their own phone. Will the rats become less social?",

    "text": "Idenifying research gaps\nIf you are interested in conducting new research on EMFs, the table below with the seven research gaps from Miles (2017) may aid you. What research gap type do you find to be the most important within EMF science?\nResearch Gap Type\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nEvidence Gap (Contradictory Evidence Gap)\nResults from studies allow for conclusions in their own right, but are contradictory when examined from a more abstract point of view [Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Miles, 2017].\n\n\nKnowledge Gap (Knowledge Void Gap)\nDesired research findings do not exist [Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Miles, 2017].\n\n\nPractical-Knowledge Gap (Action-Knowledge Conflict Gap)\nProfessional behavior or practices deviate from research findings or are not covered by research [Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Miles, 2017].\n\n\nMethodological Gap (Method and Research Design Gap)\nA variation of research methods is necessary to generate new insights or to avoid distorted findings [Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Miles, 2017].\n\n\nEmpirical Gap (Evaluation Void Gap)\nResearch findings or propositions need to be evaluated or empirically verified [Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Miles, 2017].\n\n\nTheoretical Gap (Theory Application Void Gap)\nTheory should be applied to certain research issues to generate new insights. There is lack of theory thus a gap exists [Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014; Miles, 2017].\n\n\nPopulation Gap\nResearch regarding the population that is not adequately represented or under-researched in the evidence base of prior research (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, age, etc.) [Robinson, et al, 2011].\n\n\nSources\nRobinson, Saldanhea, & McKoy (2011); Müller-Bloch & Kranz, (2015); Miles, (2017).",
