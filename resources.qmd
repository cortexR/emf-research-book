# Resources (draft)

In this part of the book, various resources that can aid in research on electromagnetic fields. The various chapters holds resources such as information on literature databases, open data and scientific communities around the world.

## Idenifying research gaps

If you are interested in conducting new research on EMFs, the table below with *the seven research gaps* from @milesTaxonomyResearchGaps2017 may aid you. What research gap *type* do you find to be the most important within EMF science?
