### Blood pressure

Cell phone calls, and thus radiofrequency radiation, may be related to the development of high *blood-pressure* (hypertension) , according to a large study using data from the UK Biobank [@yeMobilePhoneCalls2023a]. Radiation exposure can be assumed to be strongly affected by cell phone usage. Confounding factors and other explanatory models can always exist. Mecanistic models for how a blood pressure increase can happen due to radiofrequency radiation, is a topic for future studies, â€“ and such studies will increase the confidence in the findings from epidemiological studies on cell phone usage or similar exposure, and blood pressure.
