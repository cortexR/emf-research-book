# Exposure in general (draft)

## Fifth generation mobile phone technology (5G)

*Non-user exposure:*

A 2023 study performed measurements "near two 5G New Radio (NR) base stations, one with an Advanced Antenna System (AAS) capable of **beamforming** and the other a traditional microcell." (emphasizment/bold part added)[@aertsRFEMFExposure5G2023].

They found that exposure was in general lower for non-users than for users, but that "for the non-user, the difference lies in whether they are in a beam or not" and that when there are many users around the base station exposure can generally increase for the non-user.
