# Long leaps and speculations (draft)

Here are some speculative theories or ideas. The ideas are only sicentific in so far that they are possible to test and disprove (falsify). They might be stimulating, engaging or just fun or provocative to read.

1)  Today, all have their own phones. Particularly with the introduction of the fifth generation of mobile technlogy (5G) and beamforming, being close to others can increase exposure. \
    If it is so that RF-EMF is a stressor, a question becomes, can there be *subliminal conditioning* (*pavlovian*), where the body experience stress when close to others, and thus starts to associate being close to others as stressful. \
    How can such a theory be tested? Rats can be mounted with their own mini "mobile phone" with beamforming technology in a rat city with transmission antennas around the "city". Control groups do not have their own phone. Will the rats become less social?
