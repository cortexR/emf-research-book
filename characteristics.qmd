## Natural electromagnetism

### Space and the sun

*Coronal mass ejection (CME)*: 
Ejection of plasma mass from the sun. One often talks about flares, and flares 
of different strength, e.g. X1 to X100. The Carrington event (1859) is said to
have been between X45 or  X80 flare (ADD REFERENCE). One also talk about the 
KP-index â€“ the geomagnetic storm index, with values like typically Kp5-Kp9.


*Cosmic microwave background radiation* (CMB(R)): (LOOK UP AND IMPROVE TERMINOLOGY
AND ABREVIATION, NOT SURE IF THIS IS USED OR COMMONLY USED)
