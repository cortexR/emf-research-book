  abstract = {Of particular interest within fifth generation (5G) cellular networks are the typical levels of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by `small cells', low-power base stations, which are installed such that both workers and members of the general public can come in close proximity with them. In this study, RF-EMF measurements were performed near two 5G New Radio (NR) base stations, one with an Advanced Antenna System (AAS) capable of beamforming and the other a traditional microcell. At various positions near the base stations, with distances ranging between 0.5 m and 100 m, both the worst-case and time-averaged field levels under maximized downlink traffic load were assessed. Moreover, from these measurements, estimates were made of the typical exposures for various cases involving users and non-users. Comparison to the maximum permissible exposure limits issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) resulted in maximum exposure ratios of 0.15 (occupational, at 0.5 m) and 0.68 (general public, at 1.3 m). The exposure of non-users was potentially much lower, depending on the activity of other users serviced by the base station and its beamforming capabilities: 5 to 30 times lower in the case of an AAS base station compared to barely lower to 30 times lower for a traditional antenna.},

  abstract = {Background: The exponential growth in mobile phone usage has raised concerns about electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure and its health risks. Blood pressure and BMI, which impair heart function due to decreased adrenoreceptor responsiveness, parasympathetic tone withdrawal, and increased sympathetic activity, may further exacerbate these risks. However, the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic (RF-EM) exposure from mobile phones on electrocardiograms (ECGs) and heart rate variability (HRV) in individuals remain unclear. Purpose: Building upon our previous findings on HRV changes due to mobile phone proximity, this study is aimed at significantly enhancing the analytical approach used to assess the effects of mobile phones on cardiac parameters. This study exploits data from a previous study but with a different purpose. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to examine whether exposure to mobile phones changes the five variables (P-R, QRS, QT, ST, and HR) in a multivariate manner and (b) to examine whether the blood pressure and/or the body mass index (BMI), which acts as a proxy for obesity, have an effect on the change of these five variables. For both aspects of the study, four cycles are performed. Method: We conducted multivariate analysis on previously collected electrical cardiac measurement data from 20 healthy male subjects exposed to mobile phone EMF, with the mobile phones placed at four different body locations. The one-sample Hotelling T 2 test on the mean vector of differences was utilised instead of multiple paired t-tests. This multivariate method comprehensively analyzes data features and accounts for variable correlations, unlike multiple univariate analyses. Given our small sample size, we employed the MMPC variable selection algorithm to identify predictor variables significantly related to mean changes. Results: Significant alterations in ECG intervals and heart rate were noted in the subjects before and after the first EMF exposure cycle, independent of their BMI. Notably, heart rate, P-R, and QRS intervals fell postexposure while QT and ST intervals increased. These changes were influenced by variations in systolic blood pressure, with BMI showing no significant effect. Conclusion: The observed modifications in cardiac electrical measurements due to mobile phone EMF exposure are attributed to the effects of EMF itself, with no impact from BMI on the extent of these changes.},

  abstract = {The influence of radiofrequency electromagnetic exposure on ligand binding to hydrophobic receptor proteins is a plausible early event of the interaction mechanism. A comprehensive quantum Zeeman-Stark model has been developed which takes into account the energy losses of the ligand ion due to its collisions inside the receptor crevice, the attracting nonlinear endogenous force due to the potential energy of the ion in the binding site, the out of equilibrium state of the ligand-receptor system due to the basal cell metabolism, and the thermal noise. The biophysical "output" is the change of the ligand binding probability that, in some instances, may be affected by a suitable low intensity exogenous electromagnetic "input" exposure, e.g., if the depth of the potential energy well of a putative receptor protein matches the energy of the radiofrequency photon. These results point toward both the possibility of the electromagnetic control of biochemical processes and the need for a new database of safety standards.},

  abstract = {Our goal was to investigate effects of long-term exposure to pulsed microwave radiation. The major emphasis was to expose a large sample of experimental animals throughout their lifetimes and to monitor them for effects on general health and longevity. An exposure facility was developed that enabled 200 rats to be maintained under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions while housed individually in circularly-polarized waveguides. The exposure facility consisted of two rooms, each containing 50 active waveguides and 50 waveguides for sham (control) exposures. The experimental rats were exposed to 2,450-MHz pulsed microwaves at 800 pps with a 10-microseconds pulse width. The pulsed microwaves were square-wave modulated at 8-Hz. Whole body calorimetry, thermographic analysis, and power-meter analysis indicated that microwaves delivered at 0.144 W to each exposure waveguide resulted in an average specific absorption rate (SAR) that ranged from 0.4 W/kg for a 200-g rat to 0.15 W/kg for an 800-g rat. Two hundred male, Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned in equal numbers to radiation-exposure and sham-exposure conditions. Exposure began at 8 weeks of age and continued daily, 21.5 h/day, for 25 months. Animals were bled at regular intervals and blood samples were analyzed for serum chemistries, hematological values, protein electrophoretic patterns, thyroxine, and plasma corticosterone levels. In addition to daily measures of body mass, food and water consumption by all animals, O2 consumption and CO2 production were periodically measured in a sub-sample (N = 18) of each group. Activity was assessed in an open-field apparatus at regular intervals throughout the study. After 13 months, 10 rats from each group were euthanatized to test for immunological competence and to permit whole-body analysis, as well as gross and histopathological examinations. At the end of 25 months, the survivors (11 sham-exposed and 12 radiation-exposed rats) were euthanatized for similar analyses. The other 157 animals were examined histopathologically when they died spontaneously or were terminated in extremis.},

  abstract = {The current deployment of the fifth generation of wireless communication technology Q13 (5G) has reignited the long-standing debate around the possibility of health effects from the radiation emitted by the existing wireless communication devices and networks and the new ones introduced by the 5G. The opposition of the part of society toward wireless communication technologies is caused by the uncertainty of whether this radiation affects humans as well as fauna and flora.Some of the population considers themselves sensitive to wireless radiation, the socalled electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). Currently, the existence of EHS has not yet been proven scientifically. However, according to the definition of health of the World Health Organization (1) where ``health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity'', any person believing his/her health is affected or sensitive to wireless radiation experiences a health effect caused by the wireless radiation. According to the WHO definition of health, just a belief in having EHS and experiencing non-specific symptoms, physiological and/or psychological, is experiencing the health effects of wireless technology. Hence, it is correct to claim that wireless radiation causes health effects.The existence of individual sensitivity to wireless radiation has not been proven yet, or disproven because to date performed research is inadequate. Of course, it is challenging to prove things with science as an infinite number of potential confounders and covariates need to be considered. However, science should be used to evaluate the balance of probability whether a hypothesis is plausible. Hence, providing an absolute proof might be elusive. Most of the research on EHS was conducted using psychology methods, asking a person, who is concerned that wireless exposure might affect health of the wireless radiation exposure, how the person feels during the real or the sham exposure. Puzzlingly, the frequent observation that the self-declared EHS person can't feel the wireless radiation and can't recognize when the wireless transmitter emits radiation and when it is not transmitting, is considered ultimate proof that the form of individual sensitivity to wireless radiation called EHS is not caused by wireless radiation exposures. This is questionable as no person, sensitive or not, could feel the ionizing radiation or other non-ionizing radiation like ultraviolet in their environment. Thus, research on EHS and individual sensitivity to wireless radiation, in general, has generated scientifically subjective data, unreliable for public health recommendations or radiation safety limits. On the contrary, logically and per analogiam with other environmental factors, individual sensitivity to wireless radiation, which includes EHS, exists as indicated below, and should be studied using biochemical methods.},
