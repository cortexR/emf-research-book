  abstract = {Background: The exponential growth in mobile phone usage has raised concerns about electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure and its health risks. Blood pressure and BMI, which impair heart function due to decreased adrenoreceptor responsiveness, parasympathetic tone withdrawal, and increased sympathetic activity, may further exacerbate these risks. However, the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic (RF-EM) exposure from mobile phones on electrocardiograms (ECGs) and heart rate variability (HRV) in individuals remain unclear. Purpose: Building upon our previous findings on HRV changes due to mobile phone proximity, this study is aimed at significantly enhancing the analytical approach used to assess the effects of mobile phones on cardiac parameters. This study exploits data from a previous study but with a different purpose. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to examine whether exposure to mobile phones changes the five variables (P-R, QRS, QT, ST, and HR) in a multivariate manner and (b) to examine whether the blood pressure and/or the body mass index (BMI), which acts as a proxy for obesity, have an effect on the change of these five variables. For both aspects of the study, four cycles are performed. Method: We conducted multivariate analysis on previously collected electrical cardiac measurement data from 20 healthy male subjects exposed to mobile phone EMF, with the mobile phones placed at four different body locations. The one-sample Hotelling T 2 test on the mean vector of differences was utilised instead of multiple paired t-tests. This multivariate method comprehensively analyzes data features and accounts for variable correlations, unlike multiple univariate analyses. Given our small sample size, we employed the MMPC variable selection algorithm to identify predictor variables significantly related to mean changes. Results: Significant alterations in ECG intervals and heart rate were noted in the subjects before and after the first EMF exposure cycle, independent of their BMI. Notably, heart rate, P-R, and QRS intervals fell postexposure while QT and ST intervals increased. These changes were influenced by variations in systolic blood pressure, with BMI showing no significant effect. Conclusion: The observed modifications in cardiac electrical measurements due to mobile phone EMF exposure are attributed to the effects of EMF itself, with no impact from BMI on the extent of these changes.},

  abstract = {The influence of radiofrequency electromagnetic exposure on ligand binding to hydrophobic receptor proteins is a plausible early event of the interaction mechanism. A comprehensive quantum Zeeman-Stark model has been developed which takes into account the energy losses of the ligand ion due to its collisions inside the receptor crevice, the attracting nonlinear endogenous force due to the potential energy of the ion in the binding site, the out of equilibrium state of the ligand-receptor system due to the basal cell metabolism, and the thermal noise. The biophysical "output" is the change of the ligand binding probability that, in some instances, may be affected by a suitable low intensity exogenous electromagnetic "input" exposure, e.g., if the depth of the potential energy well of a putative receptor protein matches the energy of the radiofrequency photon. These results point toward both the possibility of the electromagnetic control of biochemical processes and the need for a new database of safety standards.},

We aimed to examine the associations of mobile phone use for making or receiving calls and the use frequency with new-onset hypertension in the general population, using data from the UK Biobank.A total of 212 046 participants without prior hypertension in the UK Biobank were included. Participants who have been using a mobile phone at least once per week to make or receive calls were defined as mobile phone users. The primary outcome was new-onset hypertension. During a median follow-up of 12.0 years, 13 984 participants developed new-onset hypertension. Compared with mobile phone non-users, a significantly higher risk of new-onset hypertension was found in mobile phone users [hazards ratio (HR), 1.07; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01--1.12]. Among mobile phone users, compared with those with a weekly usage time of mobile phones for making or receiving calls \&lt;5 mins, significantly higher risks of new-onset hypertension were found in participants with a weekly usage time of 30--59 mins (HR, 1.08; 95\%CI: 1.01--1.16), 1--3 h (HR, 1.13; 95\%CI: 1.06--1.22), 4--6 h (HR, 1.16; 95\%CI: 1.04--1.29), and \&gt;6 h (HR, 1.25; 95\%CI: 1.13--1.39) (P for trend \&lt;0.001). Moreover, participants with both high genetic risks of hypertension and longer weekly usage time of mobile phones making or receiving calls had the highest risk of new-onset hypertension.Mobile phone use for making or receiving calls was significantly associated with a higher risk of new-onset hypertension, especially among high-frequency users.},
